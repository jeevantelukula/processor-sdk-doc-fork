Buildroot is an open-source, simple, and efficient tool for building complete
Linux systems for embedded devices. It automates the process of generating
cross-compiled toolchains, root filesystems, Linux kernels, and bootloaders.
Buildroot is highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor their Linux
environment to meet the specific needs of their embedded projects.

Buildroot official Git repository is hosted at `Gitlab/Buildroot <https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/>`__.

    accessible for developers with varying levels of experience in embedded
    systems.
#. **Customization**:
    With a vast library of packages and a flexible configuration system,
    Buildroot allows for extensive customization of the target system.
#. **Efficiency**:
    Buildroot’s minimalistic approach ensures that the generated system is lean
    and efficient, which is critical for resource-constrained embedded
    environments.

***********************
Buildroot External Tree
***********************

TI provides a Buildroot external tree `Github/TexasInstruments <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/buildroot-external-TI>`__.
, to incorporate TI specific configurations and packages. This external
tree allows to customize and extend the Buildroot environment without modifying
the original Buildroot source code. It serves as a centralized repository for
custom configurations, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. The entire
project is made public and we accept community contributions as pull requests
to github repository.

Technical Support
*****************

Technical support is a broad term. Our desire is to provide a solid
product, good documentation, and useful training that defines a clear
path for developing a product based on the Linux/Debian/Buildroot/RTOS/Android
SDKs. However, we know we'll never cover everything that can be done, and
occasionally we even make mistakes <gasp>. So, when you can't seem to
find what you need, there's a good place to search through previously
answered questions and ask a new one - The E2E Support Forums.

There is an active community of TIers and other customers like you
already using a TI Processor, on these forums. You may find your
question has already been answered with a quick Search of the Forums. If
not, a quick post will likely provide you the answers you need.
