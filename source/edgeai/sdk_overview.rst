**Welcome to Processor SDK Linux Edge AI for** |__PART_FAMILY_NAME__| **!**

The SDK provides software and tools to let the users effectively balance
deep learning performance with system power and cost on Texas Instrumentâ€™s
processors for edge AI applications. We offer a practical embedded inference
solution for next-generation vehicles, smart cameras, edge AI boxes, and
autonomous machines and robots. In addition to general purpose micro processors,
|__PART_FAMILY_NAME__| has integrated micro controllers, DSP, and accelerators
for neural network, image, vision, and multimedia processing. With a few simple
steps one can run high performance computer vision and deep learning demos
using a live camera and display.

   Processor SDK Linux Edge AI for |__PART_FAMILY_NAME__| feature overview


The SDK also enables an interplay of multiple open-source components such as
GStreamer, OpenVx, OpenCV and deep learning runtime such as TFLite, ONNX and
Neo-AI DLR. The reference applications showcase perception based examples such
as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation in both
Python and C++ variants. The SDK supports edit-build-debug cycles directly on
the target and also on PC to cross compile and build the applications.
