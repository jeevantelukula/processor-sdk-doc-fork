Configuring applications
========================

The demo config file uses YAML format to define input sources, models, outputs
and finally the flows which defines how everything is connected. Config files
for out-of-box demos are kept in ``edgeai-gst-apps/configs`` folder. The
folder contains config files for all the use cases and also multi-input and
multi-inference case. The folder also has a template YAML file
``app_config_template.yaml`` which has detailed explanation of all the
parameters supported in the config file.

Config file is divided in 4 sections:

#. Inputs
#. Models
#. Outputs
#. Flows

Inputs
======

The input section defines a list of supported inputs like camera, video files etc.
Their properties like shown below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    inputs:
        input0:                                                         #Camera Input
            source: /dev/video-usb-cam0                                 #Device file entry of the camera
            format: jpeg                                                #Input data format supported by camera
            width: 1280                                                 #Width and Height of the input
            height: 720
            framerate: 30                                               #Framerate of the source

        input1:                                                         #Video Input
            source: /opt/edgeai-test-data/videos/video0_1280_768.h264   #Video file
            format: h264                                                #File encoding format
            width: 1280
            height: 768
            framerate: 30

        input2:                                                         #Image Input
            source: /opt/edgeai-test-data/videos/images/%04d.jpg        #Sequence of Image files, printf style formatting is used
            width: 1280
            height: 720
            index: 0                                                    #Starting Index (optional)
            framerate: 1

All supported inputs are listed in template config file.
Below are the details of most commonly used inputs.

.. _pub_edgeai_camera_sources:

Camera sources (v4l2)
---------------------

**v4l2src** GStreamer element is used to capture frames from camera sources
which are exposed as v4l2 devices. In Linux, there are many devices which are
implemented as v4l2 devices. Not all of them will be camera devices. You need
to make sure the correct device is configured for running the demo successfully.

``init_script.sh`` is ran as part of systemd, which detects all cameras connected
and prints the detail like below in the console:

.. code-block:: bash

   /opt/edgeai-gst-apps# ./init_script.sh
   USB Camera detected
       device = /dev/video-usb-cam0
       format = jpeg
   CSI Camera 0 detected
       device = /dev/video-imx219-cam0
       format = [fmt:SRGGB8_1X8/1920x1080]
       subdev_id = /dev/v4l-imx219-subdev0
       isp_required = yes

script can also be run manually later to get the camera details.

From the above log we can determine that 1 USB camera is connected
(/dev/video-usb-cam0), and 1 CSI camera is connected (/dev/video-imx219-cam0) which is IMX219 raw
sensor and needs ISP.

Using this method, you can configure correct device for camera capture in the
input section of config file.

.. code-block:: bash

    input0:
        source: /dev/video-usb-cam0     #USB Camera
        format: jpeg                    #if connected USB camera supports jpeg
        width: 1280
        height: 720
        framerate: 30

    input1:
        source: /dev/video-imx219-cam0     #IMX219 raw sensor that needs ISP
        format: rggb                    #ISP will be added in the pipeline
        width: 1920
        height: 1080
        framerate: 30
        subdev-id: /dev/v4l-imx219-subdev0 #needed by ISP to control sensor params via ioctls

Make sure to configure correct ``format`` for camera input. ``jpeg`` for USB
camera that supports MJPEG (Ex. C270 logitech USB camera). ``auto`` for CSI
camera to allow GStreamer to negotiate the format. ``rggb`` for sensor
that needs ISP.

Video sources
-------------

H.264 and H.265 encoded videos can be provided as input sources to the demos.
Sample video files are provided under ``/opt/edgeai-test-data/videos/``

.. code-block:: yaml

    input1:
        source: /opt/edgeai-test-data/videos/video0_1280_768.h264
        format: h264
        width: 1280
        height: 768
        framerate: 30

    input2:
        source: /opt/edgeai-test-data/videos/video0_1920_1088.h264
        format: h264
        width: 1920
        height: 1088
        framerate: 30

Make sure to configure correct ``format`` for video input as shown above.
By default the format is set to ``auto`` which will then use the GStreamer
bin ``decodebin`` instead.

Image sources
-------------

JPEG compressed images can be provided as inputs to the demos. A sample set of
images are provided under ``/opt/edgeai-test-data/images``. The names of the
files are numbered sequentially and incrementally and the demo plays the files
at the fps specified by the user.

.. code-block:: yaml

    input2:
        source: /opt/edgeai-test-data/images/%04d.jpg
        width: 1280
        height: 720
        index: 0
        framerate: 1

RTSP sources
------------

H.264 encoded video streams either coming from a RTSP compliant IP camera or
via RTSP server running on a remote PC can be provided as inputs to the demo.

.. code-block:: yaml

    input0:
        source: rtsp://172.24.145.220:8554/test # rtsp stream url, replace this with correct url
        width: 1280
        height: 720
        framerate: 30

Models
======

The model section defines a list of models that are used in the demo. Path to
the model directory is a required argument for each model and rest are optional
properties specific to given use cases like shown below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    models:
        model0:
            model_path: /opt/model_zoo/TFL-OD-2020-ssdLite-mobDet-DSP-coco-320x320      #Model Directory
            viz_threshold: 0.6                                                          #Visualization threshold for adding bounding boxes (optional)
        model1:
            model_path: /opt/model_zoo/ONR-CL-6360-regNetx-200mf
            topN: 5                                                                     #Number of top N classes (optional)
        model2:
            model_path: /opt/model_zoo/ONR-SS-8610-deeplabv3lite-mobv2-ade20k32-512x512
            alpha: 0.4                                                                  #alpha for blending segmentation mask (optional)


Below are some of the use case specific properties:

#. **viz_threshold**: Score threshold to draw the bounding boxes for detected
   objects in object detection. This can be used to control the number of boxes
   in the output, increase if there are too many and decrease if there are very
   few
#. **topN**: Number of most probable classes to overlay on image classification
   output
#. **alpha**: This determines the weight of the mask for blending the semantic
   segmentation output with the input image ``alpha * mask + (1 - alpha) * image``

The content of the model directory and its structure is discussed in detail in
:ref:`pub_edgeai_import_custom_models`


Outputs
=======

The output section defines a list of supported outputs.

.. code-block:: yaml

   outputs:
       output0:                                                         #Display Output
           sink: kmssink
           width: 1920                                                  #Width and Height of the output
           height: 1080
           overlay-perf-type: graph                                     #Overlay performance stat (graph or text default:No overlay)
           connector: 39                                                #Connector ID for kmssink (optional)

       output1:                                                         #Video Output
           sink: /opt/edgeai-test-data/outputs/output_video.mkv         #Output video file
           width: 1920
           height: 1080

       output2:                                                         #Image Output
           sink: /opt/edgeai-test-data/outputs/output_image_%04d.jpg    #Image file name, printf style formatting is used
           width: 1920
           height: 1080

       output3:
           sink: remote                                                 #Publish output to udp port as jpeg encoded frames
           width: 1920
           height: 1080
           port: 8081                                                   #udp port (default:8081)
           host: 127.0.0.1                                              #udp host (default:0.0.0.0)
           encoding: jpeg                                               #encoding type (jpeg or mp4)


All supported outputs are listed in template config file.
Below are the details of most commonly used outputs

Display sink (kmssink)
----------------------

When you have only one display connected to the SK, kmssink will try to use
it for displaying the output buffers. In case you have connected multiple
display monitors (e.g. Display Port and HDMI), you can select a specific display
for kmssink by passing a specific connector ID number.
Following command finds out the connected displays available to use.

**Note**: Run this command to check which display is connected. The first number in each
line is the connector-id to be used in the next step.

.. code-block:: bash

    /opt/edgeai-gst-apps# modetest -M tidss -c | grep connected
    39      38      connected       DP-1            530x300         12      38
    48      0       disconnected    HDMI-A-1        0x0             0       47

Configure the required connector ID in the output section of the config file.

Video sinks
-----------
The post-processed outputs can be encoded in H.264 format and stored on disk.
Please specify the location of the video file in the configuration file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    output1:
        sink: /opt/edgeai-test-data/outputs/output_video.mkv    #(.mkv or .mp4 or .mov)
        width: 1920
        height: 1080

Image sinks
-----------
The post-processed outputs can be stored as JPEG compressed images.
Please specify the location of the image files in the configuration file.
The images will be named sequentially and incrementally as shown.

.. code-block:: yaml

    output2:
        sink: /opt/edgeai-test-data/outputs/output_image_%04d.jpg
        width: 1920
        height: 1080

Remote sinks
------------
Post-processed frames can be encoded as jpeg or h264 frames and send as udp packets
to a port. Please specify the sink as remote in the configuration file. The udp port and
host to send packets to can be defined. If not, default port is 8081 and host
is 127.0.0.1.

.. code-block:: yaml

    output3:
        sink: remote
        width: 1920
        height: 1080
        port: 8081
        host: 127.0.0.1
        encoding: jpeg  #(jpeg or h264)

A NodeJS server is provided under  ``/opt/edgeai-gst-apps/scripts/remote_streaming``
which establishes a node server on the target and listens to the udp port (8081)
on localhost (127.0.0.1) and can be used to view the frames remotely.

.. code-block:: bash

    /opt/edgeai-gst-apps# node scripts/remote_streaming/server.js


Flows
=====

The flows section defines how inputs, models and outputs are connected.
Multiple flows can be defined to achieve multi input, multi inference as shown

.. note::
    The format of specifying flows is changed as of 08.05.00 release to enable multiple outputs in the same sub-flow
    The older config files may not be compatible from this release onwards and should be changed to below format

.. code-block:: yaml

    flows:
        # flowname : [input,mode1,output,[mosaic_pos_x,mosaic_pos_y,width,height]]
        flow0: [input0,model0,output0,[160,90,800,450]]
        flow1: [input0,model1,output0,[960,90,800,450]]
        flow2: [input1,model2,output0,[160,540,800,450]]
        flow3: [input1,model3,output0,[960,540,800,450]]

Each flow defined here has exactly **1 input** and **1 model**. If multiple
flows have same input, they are clubbed together internally in the application
for optimization. Along with input, models and outputs it is required to define
**n mosaics** which are the position of the inference output in the final output
plane. This is needed because multiple inference outputs can be rendered to same
output (Ex: Display).


GStreamer plugins
=================

The edgeai-gst-apps essentially constructs GStreamer pipelines for dataflow.
This pipeline is constructed optimally and dynamically based on a pool of
specific plugins available on the platform. The defined pool of plugins for
different platform can be found in ``edgeai-gst-apps/configs/gst_plugin_maps.yaml``
file.

This file contains the plugin used for certain task and the property of plugin
(if applicable).
